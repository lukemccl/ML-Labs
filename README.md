# ML-Labs

A collection of the practical labs completed over my specialisation year in Artifical Intelligence at University of Southampton.

## COMP6247: Reinforcement and Online Learning

The module primarily focused on Online Learning, with labs based around implementing algorithms we had been shown the mathematical basis of during lectures. These algorithms grew in complexity, from Recursive Least Squares to Kalman Filter and finally implenting Particle Filters with SARSA.

The final coursework of the module brought in the teaching of Reinforcement Learning techniques, implementing Q-Learning techniques using the OpenAI Gym environment to solve the mountain car problem.
